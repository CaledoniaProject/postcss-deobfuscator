## Introduction

I found a site where most CSS class names are obfuscated using postcss-obfuscator, so I built a deobfuscator to simplify things. It supports normal classes, @keyframes, and @media queries. For legal reasons, I can't include examples in the repo, but the code is clean and easy to understandâ€”feel free to explore it yourself.
